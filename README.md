Deep-Learning-Speaker Classification
====================================

### Project Description ###

Project to learn about speech recognition - both Speaker Diarization and other Speech Recognition applications.

The first objective will be to implement Speaker Classification using an SVM.

### Current Data Set ###

The data being used for this project can be found at: http://www.openslr.org/12/ . Openslr is an open source project dedicated to hosting speech and language resources, hoping to assist the progress of speech recognition.

### Previous Work Done ###

   1. Pannous is a project that is working on implementing Speech Recognition in Google's Tensorflow.
